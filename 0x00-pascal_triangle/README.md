## About
Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that produces a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is generated by adding the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding 1s to both ends and filling in the interior numbers according to the rule
