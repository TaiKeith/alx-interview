# 0x02. Minimum Operations
`Algorithm` `Python`

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

## Concepts Needed:
1. **Dynamic Programming:**
    * Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

2. **Prime Factorization:**
    * Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.

## Strategic Overview
You start with a text file that has a single character "H". You want to perform a series of operations on the file to get exactly n "H" characters. There are only two allowed operations:
1. Copy All: This copies all the current "H" characters.
2. Paste: This pastes the last copied set of "H" characters.

The goal is to find the fewest number of operations needed to end up with exactly n H characters.
The trick here is that copying a larger group of Hs helps achieve a bigger number faster. Here's the key realization:
* At any step, the number of "H" characters you can create in one go depends on how many you've already copied.

So, you need to figure out when it's best to copy all the Hs you have. Here's a critical insight:
* If you want to get n Hs, it's useful to think of it in terms of factors. Why?
>If you have a number that's divisible by another, you can copy and paste efficiently.

For example:
* For 6 Hs, it's better to:
    * Copy 3 Hs when you have them (after copying 1 and pasting twice to reach 3).
    * Paste the 3 Hs once more to reach 6.

To solve this optimally, you can think of the following approach:
1. Start with 1 H.
2. Identify when it's better to copy and paste based on factors of the target number n.
3. For each factor of n, use Copy All followed by repeated Pastes until you reach exactly n.
