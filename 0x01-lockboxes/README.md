# 0x01. Lockboxes
`Algorithm` `Python`

## For this task, here's a strategic overview:
1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:**
* You have `n` boxes, each represented as a list of keys.
* Each box is numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and the first box (`boxes[0]`) is already unlocked.
* The goal is to check if you can eventually open all the boxes by collecting keys as you proceed.

2. **Approach:**
* Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS):
- This problem can be approached like a graph traversal problem, where each box is a node, and the keys in each box are the edges to other nodes (boxes).
- We can use either BFS or DFS to simulate the process of opening boxes by tracking which boxes you can access with the keys you find.

3. **Data Structures:**
* Use a set or list to track the boxes that have been opened.
* A queue (for BFS) or a stack (for DFS) to hold the boxes you are ready to explore (i.e., opened).

4. **Key Collection Process:**
* Start with box `0` in your collection of opened boxes.
* Use the keys inside each box to open other boxes, adding them to your list of opened boxes.
* Continue this process until either: You have opened all boxes, or There are no new boxes to open (some boxes remain locked without any keys).

5. **End Condition:**
* After the traversal, if the number of opened boxes equals the total number of boxes, return `True` (all boxes can be opened). Otherwise, return `False`.
